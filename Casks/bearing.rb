  # The app is unsigned and un-notarized (no Moberg Developer ID). The .NET SDK ad-hoc signs the apphost,
  # which is enough to execute on Apple Silicon, but Gatekeeper refuses a *quarantined* ad-hoc bundle — so
  # this cask must be installed with --no-quarantine until a certificate exists. The caveat says so rather
  # than leaving the user with "Bearing is damaged and can't be opened", which is what it looks like.

    <<~EOS
      Bearing is not signed with an Apple Developer ID yet. If you installed without
      --no-quarantine, macOS will refuse to open it; clear the flag with:

        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Bearing.app"

      Bearing updates itself from its GitHub Releases feed — `brew upgrade` is not needed.
