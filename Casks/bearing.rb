  # Apple Silicon only, and that is a property of the release rather than of the app: a Velopack channel
  # holds one package per version and Bearing reads the plain "osx" channel, so an osx-x64 package would
  # replace the arm64 one in the same feed instead of sitting beside it. See build/velopack.sh's header.

  app "Bearing.app"

  # The `bearing` command ships inside the bundle (build/velopack.sh publishes it beside the GUI apphost)
  # and is put on PATH here, which is the only step that makes it a command rather than a file. `bearing`
  # with no arguments opens the app, so this is the whole entry point — the GUI apphost beside it is called
  # `bearing-app` precisely so this one can have the name.
  binary "#{appdir}/Bearing.app/Contents/MacOS/bearing"

  # Not zapped: the login keychain items holding connection passwords (§1.1). They are the user's
  # credentials, they are shared with any other install, and `brew zap` is not where someone expects to
  # lose them — remove them from Keychain Access if you want them gone.

  # The app is unsigned and un-notarized (no Moberg Developer ID). The .NET SDK ad-hoc signs the apphost,
  # which is enough to execute on Apple Silicon, but Gatekeeper refuses a *quarantined* ad-hoc bundle — so
  # this cask must be installed with --no-quarantine until a certificate exists. The caveat says so rather
  # than leaving the user with "Bearing is damaged and can't be opened", which is what it looks like.
  caveats do
    <<~EOS
      IF MACOS SAYS "Bearing is damaged and can't be opened" — it is not damaged. That is
      Gatekeeper refusing an unsigned app that carries the quarantine flag. Clear it:

        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Bearing.app"

      To avoid it next time, install with --no-quarantine, which Homebrew accepts only on the
      command line and a cask cannot set for you:

        brew install --cask --no-quarantine moberghr/bearing/bearing

      Bearing has no Apple Developer ID yet, which is why either step is needed at all.

      Bearing updates itself from its GitHub Releases feed — `brew upgrade` is not needed.
